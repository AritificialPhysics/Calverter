# Calverter
A 11th standard project I wrote in C++.
It's a simple Calculator, offering a basic arithmetic operation between 2 operands.
It also offers the functionality to calculate square root, and provides option for converting
multiple sub-SI units into each other.
It's written entirely in C++, and utilizes the concepts of Inheritence, Distributed Files and C++'s inherent ability to write object oriented code.
Since it's written entirely in C++, it's extremely fast.
It's a very small, portable click-to-run application, with no support required whatsoever. The download size is less than 1 MB, and the program offers a menu based interface to access its functions.
The .cbp files are present because this program was written on Code::Blocks IDE.
